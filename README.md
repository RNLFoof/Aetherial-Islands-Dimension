# Aetherial Islands
This world generation data pack seeks to redefine the standards for floating island generation. 
The typical floating island generation tends to be large fragmented land masses. Not to mention they don't have hills, rivers, or oceans. But this one does by rethinking 3d noise.

With this data pack, you'll be able to experience soaring islands, with rivers and mountains. Flat plains and caves. Structures on rolling hills, and more.

All of the structures and biomes generate with this world type, as they should. 

However, you may get issues with some structures generating in the void, but...

## Don't like Void Structures? Use the Optional "No Void Structures" mod!
This stops any weirdness with structures generating broken and cut off in the void.

## Compatibility: Does this work with <u>*insert mod name here*</u>?
If that mod changes the terrain, one of the mods will probably overwrite the other. If that mod adds biomes, it should be compatible, but if you have issues with bodies of water not generating, use the optional dependency, [Lithostitched](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithostitched). This is just because of the tricky technique I had to use to make this, along with Minecraft's weirdness with surface builders. Some issues may need specific compatibility packs made, which I may make in the future.
